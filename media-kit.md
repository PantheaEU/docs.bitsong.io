## BitSong ecosystem

#### $BTSG

BTSG is the ultimate currency for music, powering the economy of the BitSong ecosystem. Buy, sell, trade Fantokens, and NFTs on the BitSong marketplace with BTSG. Swap BTSG for other cryptocurrencies. Stake BTSG to secure the BitSong network and earn rewards.

#### Fantoken&#x20;

FanTokens let you connect with music on a whole new level. For the first time the relationship between Artists and Fans become a financiale asset. Artists can create their own Token and connect with their fans as it has never been before! Fans can explore VIP experiences, crowdfund up-and-coming talent,  seek funding for their next favoriteband tour, buy unique digital album art or discover exclusive releases.&#x20;

#### NFT

Artists can create their own NFT, Non-Fungible-Token: it is an asset, or a monetizable property that cannot be replicated in any way, but can still be bought for a specific amount of currency like any other asset. It is unique and works exactly like a collector's item and a certificate of ownership at the same time, ergo it can be bought, stored, exchanged and sold but each NFT accumulates value independently.

#### BitSong Player&#x20;

BitSong’s Player will operate with a full set of metadata from the start, meaning Aritists always receive 100% of the royalties they’re owed. Every single play. Every single time. In real time.
