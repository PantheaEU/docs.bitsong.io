## BTSG-supported Wallets

BitSong recommends using the Bitsong/Keplr wallet for BitSong mainnet BTSG and the Metamask wallet for Ethereum-based BTSG.

### Keplr

Keplr is a browser extension wallet designed to support the Cosmos Internet of Blockchains. You can use Keplr to store, send, or receive mainnet-BTSG tokens. You can also stake your BTSG tokens directly to a Validator on the BitSong mainnet from your Keplr wallet.

You will need the Chrome browser to use the Keplr wallet. You can download the wallet from the [Chrome browser extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap). You will then need to add the BitSong mainnet to your Keplr wallet [following these instructions.](../useful-guides/how-to-create-a-bitsong-wallet.md)&#x20;

### Metamask

Metamask is a browser extension and mobile app wallet for the Ethereum ecosystem and ERC20 tokens. You can use it to store, send, or receive ERC20 BTSG tokens.

Please note that you cannot stake ERC20 BTSG tokens on the BitSong mainnet.

You will need the Chrome browser, or a Chromium-based browser such as Brave or Firefox, to use Metamask. You can also download Metamask for iOS or Android on your phone.
